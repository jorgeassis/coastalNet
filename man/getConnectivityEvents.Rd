\usage{
getConnectivityEvents(
  connectivity = NULL,
  hexagonID = NULL,
  year = NULL,
  month = NULL,
  day = NULL,
  period = 180
)
}
\arguments{
\item{connectivity}{A data.table object containing the oceanographic connectivity database. This should be the result of calling 'getDataBase()' or a similar data loading function.}

\item{hexagonID}{A vector of hexagon IDs to filter events.}

\item{year}{(Optional) A numeric vector of years to limit the results.}

\item{month}{(Optional) A numeric vector of months (1-12) to limit the results.}

\item{day}{(Optional) A numeric vector of days (1-31) to limit the results.}

\item{period}{(Optional) A numeric vector specifying the minimum and maximum duration (fraction of days) of events to include. It can be a single value (maximum duration) or a vector of length 2 (e.g., 'c(10, 30)'). The maximum allowed value is 180 days. Defaults to 180 (no duration restriction).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the filtered oceanographic connectivity events.
}
\description{
\code{getConnectivityEvents} This function extracts a subset of oceanographic connectivity events from the connectivity database based on user-specified criteria. You can filter events by hexagon IDs, time periods (year, month, day), and the duration of events.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load the database (replace with your actual data loading code)
connectivity <- getDataBase() 

# Example: Filter by a single hexagon and year range
my_events <- getConnectivityEvents(connectivity, hexagonID = "131", year = 2010:2012)

# Example: Filter by multiple hexagons, month, and duration
my_events <- getConnectivityEvents(connectivity, hexagonID = c("131", "132"), month = 6, period = c(15, 45))
}
