\title{Find Hexagon IDs for Spatial Objects or Coordinates}
\usage{
getHexagonID(
  obj,
  level = "extent",
  hexagonCells = NULL,
  groupByFeature = TRUE,
  groupByFeatureName = NULL,
  buffer = 0,
  print = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A spatial object from which to extract hexagon IDs. It can be one of the following classes:
\itemize{
\item 'SpatRaster': A raster object from the 'terra' package.
\item 'sf': An 'sf' object representing points, lines, or polygons.
\item 'data.frame': A data frame with at least two columns representing longitude and latitude coordinates.
\item 'matrix': A matrix with at least two columns representing longitude and latitude coordinates.
\item 'numeric': A numeric vector of length 4 representing the extent of an area (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax).
}}

\item{level}{A character string specifying the extraction level. Options are:
\itemize{
\item 'extent': Extract hexagon IDs that are within with the bounding box of the input object (potentially expanded by the 'buffer').
\item 'site': Extract hexagon IDs that are within the individual spatial objects (typically points, or polygons) of the input object.
\item 'centroid': Extract the hexagon ID that is the centroid of the spatial objects (typically polygons) of the input object
}}

\item{hexagonCells}{An sf object defining the hexagons that define the source and sink locations of connectivity retrieved from loadHexagons function.}

\item{groupByFeature}{Logical. If TRUE, hexagon IDs are grouped or aggregated by each input spatial feature (typically polygons). Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{groupByFeatureName}{The column name of the attribute table of the object spatial object from which to extract hexagon IDs.}

\item{buffer}{(Optional) A numeric value indicating the buffer distance (in degrees) to expand the bounding box when 'level = "extent"'. Defaults to 0 (no buffer).}

\item{print}{(Optional) A logical flag. If 'TRUE', a map visualizing the selected hexagons is displayed. Defaults to 'FALSE'.}
}
\value{
A list of hexagon IDs (character). If 'obj' contains multiple geometries (e.g., an 'sf' object with multiple features), each element of the list corresponds to the hexagon IDs associated with each feature. If no hexagons are found, an empty list is returned.
}
\description{
\code{getHexagonID} This function determines the hexagon IDs from the 'coastalNet' database based on a provided spatial object or coordinates. It offers flexibility in how you define the spatial input and how the hexagon IDs are extracted.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example: SpatRaster object (extent-based)
library(terra) # Ensure the 'terra' package is loaded
my_raster <- rast(extent(0, 10, 5, 15))
hex_ids <- getHexagonID(my_raster, level = "extent")

# Example: data.frame of coordinates (site-based)
sites <- data.frame(longitude = c(-8.5, -9.2), latitude = c(37.1, 38.5))
hex_ids <- getHexagonID(sites, level = "site")

# Example: 'sf' object (centroid-based with visualization)
# (Ensure 'sf' package is loaded and you have example polygon data)
my_polygons <- st_read("path/to/my_polygons.shp") 
hex_ids <- getHexagonID(my_polygons, level = "centroid", print = TRUE)
}
